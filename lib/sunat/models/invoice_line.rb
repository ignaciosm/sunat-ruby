module SUNAT 
 
  # Generate a new line for an invoice.
  #
  # Helpers are included to make the process a little easier.
  #
  # To build a new item quickly, provide the following non-standard attributes
  # when instantiating the object. They will be used to automatically generate
  # the complex structure used in the XML.
  #
  #  * :code - the item id (optional)
  #  * :description - name of product
  #  * :quantity - converted to invoiced_quantity
  #  * :unit - currently either :product, :service, or string from UN/ECE (optional, default is :product)
  #  * :price - the price charged of a single item without taxes, either as intenger for PEN, or PaymentAmount model.
  #  * :total - effectively price x quantity, minus any discounts!
  #  * :list_price - special unit price of item including tax (see below)
  #
  # The list price requires a special "PriceTypeCode" as per Catalog 16. (See annex.) By default
  # this will automatically be set to type '01', for regular prices. If however this item is included
  # for free, provide the list price as a hash as follows:
  #
  #    :list_price => {:amount => 12345, :free => true}
  #
  # or directly:
  #
  #    line.pricing_reference = {:amount => 12345, :free => true} 
  #
  # See the PricingReference model for more details.
  #
  # Handling taxes is also complicated, see the TaxTotal model
  # for helper method details.
