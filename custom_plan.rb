require 'zeus/rails'

# This custom plan (and the zeus.json file altogether) allows us
# to use zeus and rspec without rails...
# 
# However, there is one gotcha: zeus only can execute correctly
# if we use a Gemfile with zeus and install the dependencies
# as binstubs. Otherwise, Zeus will never load the commands.
# 
# To install as binstubs, use
# 
#   bundle install --binstubs
# 
# Then, run:
# 
#   bin/zeus start
# 
# because the binstubs puts the gem executables
# into bin/ folder
